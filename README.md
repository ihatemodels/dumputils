## Welcome to Dump Utils 

# Under development and not ready to use!

**`IT is NOT ðŸš€ blazing-fast but still works!`**

This projects aims to pack and abstract the usage of all common dump utils such as all recent versions of `pg_dump & pg_dumpall` , `mysqldump`, `mongodump` and more in a single docker container. The goal is to provide orchestration (using Kubernetes) and observability of different backup procedures while still simple to use and configure.

**<p style='color:orange'>WARN:</p> This tool can NOT be used as a standalone software without the proper binaries like `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, etc... The docker containers used in the examples contains all you need. If you want to use this tool in Virtual Machines or other Environments you can follow the installation steps explained in [TOOLS.md](docs/tools.md)** 

Full detailed examples of all kind of backups, notifications and supported storage outputs can be found in the [Example Folder](example).

### Introduction

Replication handles many error cases but by far not all. What about an admin that accidentally deleted the whole Prod Cluster because they thought they were on dev? What about ransomware that affected all of your online systems? Having cold snapshot of your data `desired on other place than your data itself` is the way to remain calm. Using all of these dump tools is easy till the point where you have to scale with many databases and clusters. Then as with any modern problem you need some kind of orchestration and observability. This is why I started this project.

## Examples

### Starting Simple

##### Single Postgres Database

In this example we will backup the `sales` database running on 192.168.1.5:5432 ( Postgres Database Server version 11 ). Saving the output to our file system in the `/opt/backup/` directory. We will receive Slack notification when the backup is done or if it fails. We will use docker, so we don't have to worry about pg_tools installations as everything is packed in the docker container.  

- We will create `config.yaml` in our current directory with this content

```yaml
log:
  # choices: json|human
  type: human
  # choices: debug|info|warn|error
  level: "info"

databases:
  # dump single database example
  - name: "sales-east"
    host: 192.168.1.5
    port: 5432
    database: sales
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
    version: 11
    # enabling this will pass the -v flag to pg_dump
    # all collected output will be printed as info log message
    verbose: true
    
output:
  filesystem:
    enabled: true
    # the user which starts dumputils must have write access
    # to this destination
    path: /opt/backups/

notifiers:
  slack: # TODO: add example
```

- Run the container

```bash
user@host: docker run --rm --name dumputils -h dumputils \ 
            -v /opt/backups:/opt/backups \ 
            -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/dumputils.config.yaml \ 
            -e DUMPUTILS_CONFIG_PATH="/etc/dumputils.config.yaml" \
            -it ihatemodels1/dump-utils:latest 

time=2022-06-03T01:49:36+03:00 level=info message=dumputils started
...
```

### Using The Container As Backup-Restore Environment

- Run the container

```bash
docker run --rm --name dumputils -h dumputils -it ihatemodels1/dumputils-base:latest /bin/bash
```

- Create backup

```bash
root@dumputils: /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_dump -h 192.168.1.5 -p 5432 -U postgres -Fc -Z 9 sales -f sales.dump
```

- Upload it to `minio`

```bash
root@dumputils: mc alias set minio-onprem http://192.168.1.51 {access_key} {secret_key}
# optionally create bucker
root@dumputils: mc mb minio-onprem/mybucket
root@dumputils: mc cp sales.dump minio-onprem/mybucket
```

- Restore it on other server

```bash
root@dumputils: /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_restore -h 192.168.1.6 -p 5432 -U postgres -d sales_old sales.dump
```
